Omnifocus Importer: A simple import action for Omnifocus and Alfred
============

A simple AppleScript that allows you to import a file to Omnifocus from [Alfred App](http://alfredapp.com/). You will need Alfred and the Powerpack to use this.

Installation
----------------

To install the Omnifocus Importer in Alfred double click on the extension file.

How to use
----------------

Once installed with Alfred this works as an action on the selected file. All to-dos in the file will be imported into a new project based on the file name. 

Notes
----------------
The file format should be as follows with one to-do per row, tab deliminated:

MM-DD-YYYY	To-Do Name	Optional notes for the to-do.

This generally works best as an export from Excel.
